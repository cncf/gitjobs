    Before being able to post jobs, you need to set up an employer. We will ask you for some details, like the company's name, location or description. This information will be used in your jobs postings, but you can update it anytime.

  <p class="mb-24 text-gray-700">
    You can set up multiple employers from your account if you'd like. The employer selector on the navigation menu on the left allows you to switch between them.
